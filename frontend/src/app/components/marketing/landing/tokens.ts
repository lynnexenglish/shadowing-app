/**
 * Landing-page-only design tokens.
 *
 * SCOPE: these values are consumed exclusively by components under
 * `components/marketing/landing/**` and `components/marketing/LandingPage.tsx`.
 * They intentionally do NOT touch the MUI theme, global CSS, or any shared UI
 * component, so nothing here can leak into the authenticated app.
 *
 * Palette rationale: the ShadowSpeak logo is a blue -> violet gradient around a
 * soundwave motif, so the brand expression here is that gradient, grounded on a
 * deep navy ink and warmed by a single gold accent reserved for CTAs. Supporting
 * accents exist so icons can be individually coloured by topic instead of
 * repeating one flat brand colour everywhere.
